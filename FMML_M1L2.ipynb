There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "### Questions\n",
        "1. Does averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits give more consistent results?\n",
        "Answer:Yes, averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits, like in k-fold cross-validation, provides more consistent and reliable results. It reduces the impact of any single train-test split by considering multiple data subsets, leading to lower variance and better generalization. This approach helps create a more stable estimate of model performance across different data scenarios.\n",
        "2. Does it give more accurate estimate of test accuracy?\n",
        "Answer:Yes, averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits generally provides a more accurate estimate of test accuracy. It reduces the bias and variance that can occur from relying on a single train-test split, leading to better generalization. This method offers a more reliable reflection of how the model will perform on unseen data.\n",
        "3. What is the effect of the number of iterations on the estimate? Do we get a better estimate with higher iterations?\n",
        "Answer:Increasing the number of iterations, such as using more folds in k-fold cross-validation or running multiple train-test splits, generally improves the estimate's accuracy. More iterations reduce the variance of the estimate by averaging over more diverse subsets of the data. However, after a certain point, the improvement becomes marginal, so the gains from increasing iterations diminish.\n",
        "4. Consider the results you got for the previous questions. Can we deal with a very small train dataset or validation dataset by increasing the iterations?\n",
        "Answer:Yes, increasing iterations, such as through repeated cross-validation or more folds in k-fold cross-validation, can help mitigate the impact of a small train or validation dataset. By making more efficient use of the limited data and averaging results over multiple splits, you can obtain a more reliable estimate of model performance. However, it doesn’t solve the underlying issue of data scarcity, and the model may still struggle to generalize well.\n"
